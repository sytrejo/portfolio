# portfolio

Here is my portfolio submission. I struggled with several things and there are still some items I need to fine tune.

The website should load with no problem both from the code and from github. 

Under the contact information I provided links to my github, linkedIn and my resume. These links should open in a new tab to make navigation easier for the user. 

I provided a link to our first project in github. Rather, I provided a link to the github repository instead of the link to the launched website since I felt future employers would be more interested in the code rather than the launched final product because it makes no sense as a stand alone item. For the rest of the projects I just copied the titles from the mockup because I wasn't sure which projects we would be completing in the future. 

The Navigation should be working. 

I attempted to make my website responsive with the @media tag and also by using the grid i.e the div-->.wrapper styling in the html file. It seems to work in my local computer.
